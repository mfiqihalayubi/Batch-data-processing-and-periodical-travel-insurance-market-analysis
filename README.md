<br />

## **Background**
After seeing significant business growth in the travel sector after pandemic, a bank in Singapore (Oswalt Bank) wanted to establish a subsidiary in the travel insurance agency business. 

The bank formed a large team called the Business Expansion Team and asked the team (include me) to conduct market research for getting necessary information that needed in the process of making the new company.

**Note :**
The background above is just a fictional story with the aim of imitating a real world case

## **Objective**
1. To gain insights that can be used as a basis for determining travel insurance products which will be sold by the new company
2. To determine the destinations that will be covered by insurance products in the early
3. To determine what kind of travel insurance agency that will be implemented to this new company
4. Make batch processing for every 3 months for doing market research in every quarter to get more comperhensive insight

**Note :**
Actually, i make batch processing schedule for every 1 day. Again, the objective above is a part of fictional story with the aim of imitating a real world case

## **Flow Process**

## **Conclusion**
1. Most claims are caused by unexpected events or incidents that occur at airport and during the flight
2. From the 55,284 trips, only 1.66% (921) of the trips were recorded as having a claim 
3. Most of the claims are not caused by the conditions of the country (crime rate, accident rate, conflict, etc.)
4. Shorter travel duration has higher probability in generating than longer travel duration

## **Business Recommendation**
1. Company can offer airline insurance and travel insurance  product to differentiate between existing Travel Insurance Agency and to obtain maximum profits by attracting customers who subscribe to both types of products
2. For the first year of business operations, the insurance product can be focused to cover trip that has destination to countries in the Southeast Asia region
3. When it is first established, the company can focus promotions to potential customers who have travel duration between 0 -  30 days

## **Model Improvement Recommendation**

1. Improve the modelâ€™s precision by performing hyperparameter tuning with a broader range of hyperparameter values. Expanding the range of hyperparameters will increase the likelihood of finding a more optimal combination of hyperparameters
2. Use the GridSearch method in the hyperparameter tuning process. Since the current modeling uses the RandomSearch method, there is a possibility that a more optimal combination of hyperparameters can be found through GridSearch
